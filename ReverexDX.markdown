# Reverex: DX
---
## Preamble.
Reverex is an asymmetric 2-player cooperative game developed by my group, Tuna Melt media. Reverex DX is an offical remake of the project intended to fix significant backend limitations the Original had and implement previously impossible features.

- Purpose

Reverex DX was developed with the intention of bringing Reverex a bit further into a polished release that could be published on Steam and played by a larger audience than the original Reverex. As a result I don't have as many flashy development tidbits to share from the development of DX.

- Online Networking.

This was my main task during Reverex: DX, I had to work on converting much of the original games code base into something that could run between two machines connected in a network setting. Considering we decided to use the minimal SteamNetworking API for this task, a lot of time was dedicated to creating a toolset that could be used by other developers to generate network capable code. 

Ultimately, the toolset wasn't as polished as I would've liked, it did it's job as being something usable by the other developers and allowed us to release the game with Networking out of the box.

## Source
Sadly, as the project is not only my work, I cannot give out the source. As I can not guarantee other developers will be okay with it's distribution. However, the final game may be downloaded [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3177380/REVEREX_DX/)
