    Hi there.

  <p>
    Hello, I'm Colin Doubrough and I'm a student Game Developer at brock University who specializes in Graphics programming and systems development, this is a little slice of what I do and work on.
    at the top there are various big Projects i've worked on all with basic write ups and included videos. If you're seeing this site i've probably linked this to you alongside a resume, and other additional information. So refer to that for more detailed questions.

    Here's a small photo of me.

    I usually like to work on pet projects with a variety of engines and different software, so while everything might be a little all over the place, It should be all quite interesting. I also do a decent bit of Mod developement for games like Minecraft, but nothing interesting enough
    to put on this portfolio.
