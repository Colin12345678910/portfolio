    Hi there.

  <p>
    Hello, I'm Colin Doubrough. I'm a student Game Developer at Brock University who specializes in Graphics programming and systems development. These projects are a little slice of what I do and work on.
    Above are various big Projects I've worked on, all with basic write-ups and included videos. If you're seeing this site, I've probably linked this to you alongside a resume, and other additional information. So refer to that for more detailed questions.

    Here's a small photo of me.

    I usually like to work on pet projects with a variety of engines and different software, so while everything might be a little all over the place, It should be all quite interesting. I also do a decent bit of Mod development for games like Minecraft, but nothing interesting enough
    to put on this portfolio.
