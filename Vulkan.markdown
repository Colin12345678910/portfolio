# VulkanTests
---

VuklanTest was a render project intended to teach myself not just how Vulkan works in comparison to DirectX, but also how a game engine is actually structured. The project was started by following some resources on Vulkan, after that point I've been spending time adding onto the base engine and bringing technical features I already knew about like shadow casting to bring the engine up to my own standards. As you go through the articles written on this site, I will take you through the process of how I created a Vulkan renderer, using common rendering techinques and other toolsets.

If you don't have the time for it, I always include a screenshot of each finalized render at the beginning of each article, and a collection of screenshots I am proud of below.
